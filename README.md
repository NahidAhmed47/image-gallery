- **Sorting:** Users can easily rearrange images using a simple drag-and-drop feature for a personalized gallery order.

- **Deleting Multiple Images:** You can select multiple images and delete them with a clear visual indication of your selections.

- **Setting Feature Image:** Sorting images also lets you choose the feature image. The first image (left to right) is set as the featured one.
